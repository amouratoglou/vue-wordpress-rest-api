# Wordpress REST API and Vue.js

I will slowly migrate to this repo a couple of cool examples that I have sitting on my laptop disk 
using Wordpress REST API and Vue.js

I have been using Wordpress as a freelancer for years and every day I want to walk away from PHP more and more. 

Vue.js in that sense has become some kind of love at first sight. For anyone coming from PHP/CMS world or learning the basics of JS and Vue, some of these files might be useful.

Please don't hesitate to test Strapi, a very cool headless CMS. 

cheers
